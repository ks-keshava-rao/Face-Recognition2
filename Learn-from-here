#1 To install opencv-contrib-python library use thr following command in your command shell or command prompt
--> pip install opencv-contrib-python
#2 Algo1 - Fisher face analyzer
--> It extracts principle components that separates one individual from another
--> Generates feature vector of facial image data used by the system and then match
    vector traits of training image with vector characteristics of test image using euclidean
    distance formula
#3  LBPHFaceRecognizer (LBP)
--> is an efficient texture operator which labels
    the pixels of an image by thresholding the neighbourhood pixels and
    coverts them to binary values and later to decimal.
--> Parameters - Radius,neighbour,X grid , Y Grid.
#4 Algorithm
1) Load face detection algorithm
2) Load classifier for face recognition
3) Training classifier for dataset
4) Reading from camera and pre processing
5) Face detection by its algorithm
6) Predicting face by loading frame into model
7) Displays recognized class with its accuracy :)
